'''
Write a program that lets a user enter N and that outputs N! (N factorial, meaning N*(N-1)*(N-2)*...*2*1). Hint:Use a loop variable i that counts from total-1 down to 1. Compare your output with some of these answers: 1:1, 2:2, 3:6, 4:24, 5:120, 8:40320.

'''
N = int(input())  # Read user-entered number
total = N
# Initialize the loop variable

while i ? ??:
    # Set total to total * (i)
    # Decrement i

print(total)

'''
N = int(input())  # Read user-entered number
total = N
# Initialize the loop variable
i = 1
while total > 0:
    i = i * total
    total = total - 1

print(total)
#####What is the difference#########
N = int(input())  # Read user-entered number
total = N
# Initialize the loop variable
i = 1
while N > 0:
    i = i * N
    N = N - 1

print(total)
