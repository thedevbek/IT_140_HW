Will, You said I could use VS Code instead of PYCharm so I am going to answer the question for VS Code, but I am sure PyCharm would be similar.

Features I like about VS Code:

1. The extends I can use are wonderful. From something as simple as a spell checker to as advanced as Python IntelliSense.
2. I like the fact that I can change color themes. Since we work with an IDE/text editor a lot it is fun to change my theme ever so often as to not get bored with white text.
3. I also like the fact there is a dark version. I have eye problems and working on a bright screen all day would not be to good for my eyes. But since the screen is mainly black I don't have an issue with it.
