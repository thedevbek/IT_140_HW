'''
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Complete the program to read four values from input and store the values in variables first_name, generic_location, whole_number, and plural_noun. The program uses the input values to output a short story.'''


first_name = ''
generic_location = ''
whole_number = ''
plural_noun = ''
first_name = input('first_name: ')
generic_location = input('generic_location: ')
whole_number =input('whole_number: ')
plural_noun = input('plural_noun: ')

# Output a short story using the four input values. Do not modify the code below.
print(first_name, 'went to', generic_location, 'to buy', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun)
